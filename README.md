What is Rubycoin?
----------------

Rubycoin is a lite version of Bitcoin using scrypt as a proof-of-work algorithm.
 - 2.5 minute block targets
 - subsidy halves in 840k blocks (~4 years)
 - ~84 million total coins

The rest is the same as Bitcoin.
 - 50 coins per block
 - 2016 blocks to retarget difficulty
